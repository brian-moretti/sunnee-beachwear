# Vue Project - Sunnee Beachwear

Welcome to my first Vue project for Start2Impact University.

## The Project: Sunnee Bottle Configurator

The project opens with a welcome page introducing the Sunnee Beachwear brand and promoting its new kids collection.

The configurator allows users to customize the bottle by selecting one of ten available colors for each of its three parts: the cap, the body, and the bottom.
Users can freely go back and change the color of any part at any time during the configuration process.

At the end of the experience, users are shown a final page with a greeting message.
